# React Native Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`. This error arises when attempting to access object properties before they've been fully initialized, often due to the asynchronous nature of data fetching or state updates.

The `BuggyComponent.js` file showcases the error.  The `FixedComponent.js` file provides a solution using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.

Observe the error in the `BuggyComponent` and the corrected behavior in the `FixedComponent`.

## Solution

The solution involves using optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to safely access properties, preventing the error when the object or its properties are undefined.
