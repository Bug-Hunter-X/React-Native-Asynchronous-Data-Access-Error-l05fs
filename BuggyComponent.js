This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object before it has been fully initialized or when the object itself is null or undefined.  This is common when dealing with asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API or using state updates in React Native.  The classic symptom is that you'll see a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')` error message in your console.  This can be particularly insidious because the code may appear correct, but the timing of data updates or component rendering isn't aligned.
